# Mandelbrot-rs
A [Mandelbrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) visualizer written in Rust, using SDL2 for rendering and input.

## Note: Not originally intented for use
While you can try this program if you really want, it is not intended as a proper Mandelbrot visualizer. I decided to try and make this since I wanted to get better at programming in Rust. Therefore, I tried to keep my dependencies to a minimum (using only SDL2 and crossbeam-utils) in order to force myself to write the code myself as much as possible.
